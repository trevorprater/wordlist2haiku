which
i
came
up
with
after

a

i
would
liketo
prototype
a

executed

in

i
can
model

this
would
be
an
interesting

i
would
also
like
to

to

ultimately
id
like
this
to

however
i
would
like
to

now
as
placement
strategies
for

i
have
been
thinking
for
a

now
how
to
advance
screenwriting

beyond
being
just
considered
as
a
blueprint
for
another

i
think
its
concision
and
active
voice
can
be
appreciated
as
a
new
kind
of
popular
literature
in
its
written
form
i
see
this
is
an
opportunity
to
explore
that
i
also
feel
that
because
language
and
economics
are
such
a
central
theme
in
my
thinking
and
this
project
its
important
to
not
develop
this
with
an
obsession
toward
traditional
distribution
that
is
why
the
visualization
web
tool
is
important
to
me
id
like
to
open
it

once
i
finish
a

my

comments
about
the
archetype
of
the
feminist
cyborgduring
the
presentation
session
comments
that
i
should
have
started
with
the
story
first
rather
than
starting
bypresenting
ideas
and
background
made
sense
but
also
puzzled
me
similarly
to
my
midterm
about
time
i
have
been
living
with
these
ideas
in
my
head
and
they
are
more
complex
to
others
than
i
imagine
i
need
to
take
more
time
to
focus
my
themes
so
that
i
can
deliver
the
appropriate
information
in
easily
digestible
packets
however
i
reject
the
notion
of
narrowing
my
themes
since
that
is
the
very
nature
of
semis
problem
with
human
language
and
storytelling
its
not
a
highresolution
picture
of
reality
but
since
i
have
the
urge
to
synthesize
so
much
at
once
i
clearly
need
to
learn
how
to
do
so
at
this
level
i
am
excited
to
talk
to
more
experts
and
continue
my
writing
and
my
research
science
fiction
reading
and
my
expert
interviews
since
i
have
hit
on
a
story
concept
which
satisfies
both
my
natural
affinity
to
storytelling
as
well
as
my
concerns
about
it
and
its
interference
with
the
health
of
humanitys
concepts
of
energy
i
also
received
positive
feedback
from
class
peers
on
their
interest
level
in
the
story
material
and
my
connection
across
seemingly
disparate
disciplines
add
note
scans
one
thing
i
got
from
my
semester
in
energy
was
that
its
difficult
for
me
to
consider
the
science
of
the
study
of
energy
while
at
the
same
time
considering
the
human
economic
and
emotionalsocietalpsychological
illogic
which
specifies
its
use
in
destructive
entropic
systems
in
the
manmade
reality
we
live
in
economics
psychosocial
fabric
and
the
concept
that
everything
is
energy
and
all
living
things
including
humans
are
energyphages
i
want
to
consider
all
energy
on
the
same
level
and
so
my
ambitious
idea
was
to
take
all
major
sectors
of
the
us
economy
and
somehow
isolate
and
simplify
them
enough
to
extrapolate
them
into
an
alternate
scenario
where
they
could
some
how
be
harmonized
or
at
least
quantified
in
real
energy
terms
including
the
energy
costs
of
poorly
managed
healthcare
systems
food
and
ecological
systems
social
problems
and
other
inefficient
maladaptations
of
our
society
which
causes
enormous
amounts
of
entropy
which
arent
necessarily
identified
transparently
in
terms
of
the
toe
or
kilowatt
hours
they
cost
us
wasted
energy
which
could
be
put
toward
making
these
systems
more
efficient
instead
humans
can
do
math
but
we
cant
make
logical
decisions
or
think
far
enough
into
the
future
to
apply
logic
there
after
a
conversation
in
which
someone
suggested
i
pursue
another
approach
because
my
idea
had
no
attachment
to
reality
i
decided
i
would
use
that
as
a
strength
to
provoke
thought
about
why
this
type
of
idea
is
so
difficult
to
attach
to
reality
i
realized
that
i
wanted
to
use
this
as
a
continuation
of
the
worldbuilding
i
did
for
my
future
of
new
media
postautomation
scenario
for
2025
this
was
in
turn
a
worldbuilding
research
project
i
wanted
to
incorporate
into
my
anthropocene
final
project
a
screenplay
about
an
android
living
in
an
automated
human
society
coincidentally
my
topic
was
the
green
revolution
in
her
class
the
fossilfuel
driven
food
energy
event
which
turned
enough
solar
and
chemical
energy
into
the
largest
accumulation
of
anthropomass
to
date
its
a
dystopian
future
which
involves
the
worst
kind
of
capitalist
classism
and
it
involves
a
shocking
crisis
i
intended
it
that
way
as
a
plausible
extrapolation
of
current
trends
as
a
background
scenario
for
a
nearfuture
science
fiction
i
mean
to
make
a
point
about
how
economics
of
industry
and
human
psychology
makes
it
difficult
for
systems
engineers
and
science
leaders
to
get
the
resources
and
political
cooperation
they
need
to
take
a
transdisciplinary
approach
to
fixing
our
energy

learning
about

and

inspired
me
to
first
approach
my
crackpot
brand
of

very
simple
place
i

to

to
how

agricultural

colonialenabled
language
has
caused
us
to
lose
our
innate
animal
understanding
that
everything
is
energy
language
by
way
of
weighting
the
concepts
of
property
and
labor
as
most
important
has
divided
our
understanding
of
the
nature
of
reality
which
is
bundles
of
energy
flowing
through
points
in
space
at
varying
levels
of
stability
or
excitation
into
two
concepts
which
are
harder
to
immediately
synthesize
retrospectively
time
and
matter
time
is
the
economic
measure
of
the

we
output
for
those
who
control
the

matter
is
the
justification
of

for
the
dialogue
between

i
made
the

that

was

and
get
a
physical
sense
of
how
much
power
could
be
generated
kinetically
after
reading
about
gear
ratios
we
theorized
if
we
spun
this
lowfriction
converter
with
our
hand
it
would
work
similarly
to
a

toa

made

and
small

we
researched
mechanisms
to
move
the
magnet
we
believed
would
be
doing

this
turned
out
to
be
bogus
as
this
fatherly
youtuber
made
us
finally
realize
dont
bother
usingyoutube
to
do
research
for
building
a
homemade
generator
if
you
dont
already
know
exactly
what
constitutes
aviolationof
thelaws
of
thermodynamics
we
found
out
some
ways
that
do
because
also
neodymium
magnets
are
nothing
to
be
trifled
with
they
will
pinch
you
hard
after
giving
up
on
the
free
energy
flavor
we
continued
our
efforts
to
make
a
homemade
generator
these
efforts
ultimately
failed
to
produce
any
substantial
current
because
we
learned
a
lot
about
how
much
energy
it
takes
to
generate
energy
it
is
not
just
the
fuel
or
the
force
that
is
applied
to
a
manmade
system
its
the
energy
required
to
innovate
engineer
andmanufacture
ultimately
we
made
a
circuit
which
fulfilled
the
basic
requirements
of
the
project
but
which
found
no
innovation
in
form
or
function
paying
tribute
to
the
millenialong
struggle
of
humanity
to
its
efforts
into
useable
energy
these
activities
can
be
as
benign
as
sitting
up
in
bed
walking
to
the
bathroom
and
cleaning
or
as
hazardous
as
cooking
driving
violent
gestures
grabbing
at
hallucinated
objects
or
even
homicide
flying
back
to
the
glove
of
our
chests
thats
why
i
want
to
say
something
astonishing
like
our
hearts
are
leaving
our
bodies
to
step
out
of
their

into

tonight
i
want
to
say
something
wonderful

the

we
have
to

the

our

so
much

in
the

we
have
to

the
desperate
faith
of

return

like

and
always
they
wake
up
as

again

generally
sleepwalking
cases
consist
of
simple
repeated
behaviours
there
are
occasionally
reports
of
people
performing
complex
behaviours
while

although
their
legitimacy
is
often
disputed
sleepwalkers
often
have
little
or
no

of
the

as
their

has
altered
into
a

in
which
it
is
harder

a

appreciated

also
a

and
90

copper
pipe
brackets
for
attaching
to
the
wall
in
retrospect
i
would
not
have
selected
poplar
i
chose
it
because
it
was
cheaper
than
the
nicer
red
oak
and
because
i
wanted
to
try
something
different
from
pine
i
should
have
chosen
either
of
the
other
options
as
sanding
and
planing
the
poplar
only
seemed
to
increase
the
furry
stackofconstructionpaper
feel
i
didnt
give
the
wood
a
finish
because
it
seemed
hard
to
imagine
it
ever
being
nice
seems
too
pithy
for
my
taste
i
plan
to
paint
it
with
a
high
gloss
before
installing
the
shelves
i
enjoyed
the
monotony
of
measuring
out
the
poplar
to
be
even
and
discovering
the
pipe
cutter
was
a
delight
so
easy
i
used
the
drill
press
the
mitre
saw
the
rotary
sander
block
sander
handheld
sander
and
a
nice
planer
lent
to
me
by
a
classmate
with
a
furniture
design
background
i
never
knew
about
the
joys
of
planing—
very
satisfying
this
is
an
enclosure
prototype
i
made
for
my
physical
computing
final
since
i
made
this
its
undergone
further
iterations
using
different
materials
and
a
simplified
form
it
holds
an
iphone
and
an
arduino
uno
and
has
an
opening
for
battery
connection
access
i
chose
legos
because
they
are
familiar
yet
i
havent
played
with
them
in
a
long
time
theyre
also
a
good
way
to
make
precise
things
for
someone
without
a
technical
materials
or
engineering
background
i
selected
one
of
the
creator
kits
because
it
came
with
several
nice
joints
and
specialized
pieces
while
also
having
a
nice
range
of
basic
blocks
i
started
by
refamiliarizing
myself
with
the
types
of
pieces
and
how
they
fit
together
it
occurred
to
me
what
a
great
stress
free
aspect
legos
could
be
if
i
chose
to
incorporate
it
into
my
process
for
physical
projects
at
itp
and
beyond
im
really
satisfiedthis
was
presented
as
an
option
in
the
assignment
syllabus
i
used
found
materials
around
the
shop
a
vcr
head
i
pulled
from
an
old
unit
on
the
junk
shelf
and
a
piece
of
red
oak
from
the
scrap
wood
i
used
a
circular
saw
bit
in
the
drill
press
and
did
a
kind
of
medieval
cartoon
to
get
the
screw
holes
accurately
i
used
the
rotary
sander
to
shape
the
wood
and
a
dremmel
to
make
sure
that
the
heads
spinning
pieces
would
have
enough
room
to
spin
things
i
would
do
differently
i
wanted
to
inset
the
head
more
into
the
wood
possibly
at
an
angle
but
i
didnt
give
myself
enough
time
to
ask
someone
for
a
router
tutorial
which
would
have
been
a
better
choice
i
should
have
given
myself
time
to
scan
the
bottom
of
the
head
and
then
create
an
illustrator
file
to
laser
etch
the
screw
positions
into
the
wood
too
i
like
the
vcr
head
enough
as
an
objet
that
i
might
redo
this
the
correct
way
i
also
need
to
find
the
exactgauge
machine

to
secure
the
head

we

david
bernerslee
this
man
has
so
much
agency
concentrated
into
one
person
he
has
degrees
in
electronics
engineering
and
computer
science
he
generallyknows
how
to
make
all
the
electrons
go
exactly
where
he
wants
what
he
is
calling
for
is
a
breakdown
in
the
walls
of
capitals
innate
need
for
exclusivity
unfortunately
it
is
often
capital
which
can
afford
to
payfor
skills
like
his
which
take
a
long
time
to
cultivate
in
the
right
conditions
if
everyone
had
his
skills
then
everyone
could
use
their
security
and
oversight
and
faculty
and
facility
to
engineer
what
they
needed
and
it
could
possibly
work
better
to
share
the
information
which
everyone
would
then
be
able
to
determine
they
needed
to
get
and
share
allowing
any
site
to
link
to
any
other
site
is
necessary
but
notsufficient
for
a
robust
web
he
wants
royaltyfree
tested
open
standards
for
internet
design
covering
every
major
facet
or
terminus
and
there
should
be
many
options
for
the
birth
of
new
facets
and
terminii
think
bernerslee
is
obviously
a
visionary
he
speaks
the
truthand
hes
barking
up
one
of
the
right
trees
but
like
most
people
hes
missing
the
one
key
tree
its
the
tree
no
one
knows
how
to
practically
look
at
and
address
its
agency
i
have
curiousityhopes
that
educationalmodels
like
itp
could
spread
but
it
needs
to
be
accessible
and
normalized
then
i
think
the
internet
would
stay
free
because
it
would
be
made
of
even
more
peoples
minds
and
so
it
would
be
even
more
dynamic
and
would
be
less
tied
to
capital
infrastructure
investments
the
threat
to
net
neutrality
is
terrifyingwhat
are
some
technical
innovations
someone
like
myself
could
pursue
obviously
someone
should
and
assumedly
is
working
somewhere
on
ways
to
reduce
resources
required
for
server

i
dont

ill
ever
get

but
im
great
at
image
research
i
used
to
do
it
professionally
in
the
production

worldso
it
would
be
interesting
and
satisfying
to
develop
a
visual

as
a

when
i
was
doing

a
year
ago
this
sketch
includes
some
demod
functionality
of
using
the
mouse
toaddboth
userrepresentative
circles
as
well
as
topical

the
color
gradient
is
a
simple
example
of
how
intuitive
connections
would
be
made
between
categories
and
user
projects
the
userrepresentative
circles
fluctuate
in
size
to
reflect

or

multiple
collaborators
first
next
steps
are
to
transpose
it
to
p5js
so
that
it
can
be
user
playtested
online
for
interface
design
feedback
i
am
mainly
curious
to
know
where
the
priority
should
lie
in
terms
of
customizabilityproliferation
and
delineation
between
user
projectsideas
interestsand
then
the
outer
super

of

estimating
a
good

will
be
key
to
understanding
what

be
most
useful

the

projects
that
make
use
of
apis
coming
from
a
still
developing
film
career
im
now
searching
for
something
more
concrete
with
my
new
studies
than
to
go
through
life
begging
for
people
with
money
to
consider
me
and
my
creativity
as
legitimate
solely
in
the
context
of
art
so
normally
i
resist
it
mentally
when
i
hear
itp
referred
to
as
an
art
school
but
despite
my
twicebitten
mistrust
of
the
term
art
i
always
come
back
to
this
kind
of
thinking
quoted
in
jer
thorps
piece
which
i
do
believe
in
the
specific
function
of
modern
didactic
art
has
been
to
show
that
art
does
not
reside
in
material
entities
but
in
relations
between
people
and
between
people
and
the
components
of
their
environment
jack
burnham
ideas
making
ideas
clear
through
creative
association
and
implied
analogies
and
whatever
else
is
in
the
tool
box
but
its
analogy
of
form
concept
emotion
spatial
relationship
et
cetera
that
gives
artists
and
now
especially
digital
or
tech
oriented
artists
the
free
pass
to
step
in
and
analyze
any
topic
with
factual
data
to
find
those
connections
and
then
show
them
to
an
audience
an
application
programming
interface
is
the
common
language
that
writes
ecrypts
and
unlocks
that
hall
pass
i
like
the
focus
on
the
api
over
something
static
like
a
database
it
empowers
the
artist
to
transform
uptodate
and
changing
data
into
something
equally
uptodate
much
more
impacting
much
more
interesting
ps
looking
at
the
dronestream
twitter
feed
makes
me
lamely
ask
what
the
fuck
is
our
country
doing
obliterating
people
with
drones
stirring
up
an
anthill
to
feed
the
machine
that
makes
money
burning
the
ants
with
a
magnifying
glass
again
the
closing
quote
from
jack
burnham
thesignificant
artist
strives
to
reduce
the
technical
and
psychical
distance
between
their
artistic
output
and
the
productive
means
of
society
rings
with
my
vibes
pps
all
of
the
direct
api
links
seem
to
be
broken
in
this
writeup
i
was
moderately
delighted
that
i
somehow
subconsciously
absorbed
the
concept
of
nesting
functions
i
was
trying
to
add
a
refresh
function
to
get
an
id
and
replace
the
secondary
inner
html
with
the
original
a
clumsy
workaround
to
an
actual
loop
to
reset
something
surely
but
i
wanted
to
make
it
work
anyhow
it
wasnt
working
the
way
i
wanted
because
the
documentgetelementbyid
function
was
skipping
the
secondary
or
replaced
inner
html
and
was
instead
grabbing
the
original
defined
earlier
so
i
thought
of
nesting
the
refresh
function
and
replaced
the
secondary
inner
html
there
is
still
a
problem
of
course
i
cant
then
go
back
forward
through
the
replace
function
to
go
from
the
tertiary
inner
html
to
the
secondary
thats
again
evidence
i
need
to
implement
a
loop
i
also
used
my
css
code
from
my
week
1
homework
and
adapted
that
pretty
lightly
an
aside
so
this
isnt
a
sparkling
effort
but
im
still
working
through
how
best
to
learn
to
use
languages
and
how
to
breakdown
leftover
learning
difficultiesavoidances
from
fifth
grade
math
class
etc
people
keep
saying
all
you
need
to
do
is
spend
time
with
it
and
its
completely
true
its
the
same
with
math
hardly
anyone
is
born
good
at
math
but
i
didnt
know
that
back
then
its
your
attitude
towards
the
work
that
has
to
be
put
into
it
here
is
a
link
to
our
interaction
system
progress
update
there
are
no
new
physical
changes
to
our
prototype
we
have
been
focusing
on
developing
user
interface
ideas
with
regard
to
identifying
and
designing
for
our
target
user
after
interviewing
bike
shop
owners
we
have
determined
serious
recreational
and
professional
cyclists
are
likely
representative
of
our
user
one
insight
we
found
was
that
these
users
also
are
interested
in
applications
and
accessories
which
pair
some
kind
of
fitnesstracking
component
heart
rate
or
capacitive
electrolyte
levels
are
things
we
have
briefly
discussed
for
the
next
iteration
of
our
prototype
however
we
are
in
too
early
of
a
stage
with
the
navigational
mobile
and
functional
user
interface
stages
to
be
in
a
position
to
pursue
this
secondary
aspect
next
steps
our
next
steps
will
be
to
interview
serious
cyclists
who
come
into
bike
shops
as
well
as
get
an
untethered
playtest
of
the
bike
to
show
to
these
users
initially
had
some
syntax
error
which
i
got
through
by
troubleshooting
like
this
i
eliminated
syntax
errors
and
was
able
to
get
the
p5js
version
of
my
processing
sketch
up
and
working
however
my
file
structure
or
server
connection
still
had
an
error
so
i
was
unable
to
actually
open
the
indexhtml
file
with
google
chrome
it
kept
returning
a
404
error
or
this
despite
being
able
to
call

via

washow
to

on
a
basic

we
continue
to

our
user
survey
strategy
we
have
been
talking
to
citibike
users
at
stations
to
gather
feedback
and
insight
about
design
priorities
one
major
insight
has
been
that
citibike
users
seem
to
be
bikers
with
a
routine
or
else
are
tourists
or
nonserious
cyclists
a
pattern
which
has
arisen
is
that
casual
cyclists
do
not
seem
to
consider
that
there
could
be
another
option
to
the
dangerously
distracting
audiovisual
feedback
from
a
smartphone
naviation
system
we
are
adding
bike
shops
to
our
user
research
because
we
have
decided
to
prioritize
safety
and
believe
that
serious
recreational
or
professional
cyclists
may
be
our
initial
target

my
idea
was
to
create
a
data
graphic
using
the
enigmaios
curation
of
the
federal
governments
tracking
of
endangered
species
in
national
parks
and
other
areas
i
had
issues
with
uploading
my
json
data
i
tried
using
an
nytimes
example
which
seemed
similar
to
my
goal
then
i
used
a

which
used
a
txt
file
neither
were
good
templates
i
need
to
work
on
my
facility
with

and

further
as
well
as

i
wanted
to
make
a
beautiful
cylinder
of
sanded
polished
wood
shorter
than
it
was
wide
into
a
battery
powered
lamp
turning
our
first
fabrication
project
of
creating
a
ducttaped
circuitstyle
flashlight
on
its
head
and
instead
create
something
of
quality

concentric

turn
out
like
that
i
looked
for
turning
wood
for
too
long
without
succeeding
in
buying
anything
also
turns
out
i
needed
to
know
how
to
lathe
and
i
dont
yet
i
decided
to
prototype
the
form
i
used
a
clear
acrylic
pipecouplertype
cylinder
it
didnt
occur
to
me
to
have
them
cut
it
there
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
on
and
needed
help
using
a
hacksaw
and
handscrew
clamps
to
do
it
myself
it
was
brittle
rotary
sanding
the
ends
was
interesting
in
trying
to
drill
a
hole
to
accommodate
the
switch
i
cracked
the
acrylic
tube
in
switching
to
a
tube
from
a
solid
cylinder
i
realized
i
needed
a
good
way
to
hold
the
circuitry
in
place
i
used
a
mesh
and
the
rim
of
an
aluminum
sieve
the
only
aspect
of
my
iteration
i
favored
was
the
handsanding
of
the
acrylic
to
give
it
a
beachwashed
glass
look
i
also
kind
of
liked
the
concept
i
came
up
with
of
using
netting
to
cradle
the
innards
if
i
were
to
attempt
another
iteration
of
this
lamp
i
would
start
with
a
foam
block
and
rough
it
out
or
i
would
settle
for
an
imperfect
but
nicely
rounded
blob
of
wood
before
tackling
the
lathe
it
was
a
humbling
experience
technique

throwing
lots

at
the
last

this
is
a
nascent
prototype
for
a
haptic
feedback
navigation
system
designed
for
cyclists
a
rider
indicates
a
destination
as
simply
as
possible
with
the
interface
potentially
a
smartphone
app
the
handlebar
interface
signals
with
a
vibration
ahead
of
a
turn
and
the
confirms
its
correctness
after
the
turn
has
been
made
for
our
next
prototype
we
plan
to
incorporate
serial
communication
via
a
smartphone
app
as
well
as
an
offline
true
northindicating
mode
our
goal
is
to
pinpoint
the
frustrations
cyclists
may
have
with
current
navigation
systems
and
create
a
seamless
intuitive
experience
so
that
the
rider
can
be
free
to
pay
attention
explore
think
before
the
journey
even
begins

adding

we
set
out
to
create
an

in

the
concept
was
to
encourage
the
user
to
experience
a
degree
of
transference
to
another
type
of
being
initially
we
were
considering
a
quadruped
like
a
polar
bear
but
contemplating
our
hands
we
switched
to
an
octopus
because
the
look
and
feel
of
our
fingers
undulating
in
air
was
ripe
for
this
kind
of
transformation
we
created
a
wearable
controller
using
a
kitchen
glove
gaffers
tape
two
flex
sensors
and
an
adafruit
flora
microprocessor
we
tested
a
few
iterations
of
our
interactive
octopus
and
its
physical
interaction
here
is
a
rough
of
our
flora
circuit
schematic
originally
we
tweaked
our
sensor
mapping
with
5v
power
but
since
we
were
forced
to
use
33v
we
had
to
adjust
our
values
especially
since
we
were
dealing
with
sincosatan
values
in

oscillating

here

here

in

original

for
my
creative
expansion
on
the
servo

labs
i
chose
to
make
a
combination
of
the
two
i
used
an
analog
photoresistor
input
to
map
the
analog
tone
output
for
the
piezometer
standing
in
for
a
speaker
next
i
wired
the
servo
to
digital
pin
3
and
mapped
the
servo
angle
output
to
a
potentiometers
analog
input
into
analog
pin
5
then
i
added
a
fanblade
or
light
blocking
flag
to
the
servo
motors
bladeaxis
and
positioned
it
over
the
photoresistorpiezometer
to
modulate
that
circuit
without
needing
to
go
through
the
arduino
today
we
created
a
breadboard
circuit
closed
via
a
push
button
switch
power
was
usb
fed
through
the
usb
power
supply
i
used
a
photoresistor
to
create
a
normally
on
switch
which
disconnected
the
circuit
when
light
was
completely
blocked
i
decided
to
experiment
with
a
9v
battery
with
a
regulator
as
a
power
supply
instead
of
the
usb
power
we
tried
in
class
there
were
some
great
ideas
in
normans
chapter
from
psychology
of
things
the
ideas
he
drew
out
for
us
of
the
conceptual
model
and
the
relationship
between
the
user
model
and
the
system
image
resonates
it
in
itself
is
a
great
design
another
new
and
valuable
idea
for
me
he
articulated
was
the
idea
that
users
go
through
life
and
the
world
clumsily
interacting
with
objects
and
interfaces
and
feeling
bad
about
themselves
norman
argues
that
the
burden
falls
upon
the
designer
to
ensure
that
the
users
needs
are
met
not
just
that
the
designers
vision
and
original
parameters
are
achieved
this
is
achieved
through
trial
and
error
observation
revision
and
openmindedness
norman
claims
many
designs
fail
because
a
design
team
never
actually
tries
to
use
their
design
i
love
his
discovery
that
bad
designs
persist
because
consumers
accept
them
businesses
create
huge
commissions
or
orders
for
a
system
without
collaborating
with
the
designer
to
test
them
users
continue
to
quietly
buy
badly
designed
goods
because
they
feel
its
their
own
fault
they
cannot
use
them
well
i
think
two
topical
points
are
in
order
here
consumeruser
selfblame
is
partially
due
to
designer
arrogance
or
ignorance
but
it
is
also
due
to
isolation
of
individual
experience
in
todays
hyper
communication
trends
someone
should
design
a
better
way
to
collect
information
about
design
issues
and
not
just
apple
collecting
bug
information
cars
anvils
cameras
retractable
dog
leashes
another
issue
which
norman
doesnt
go
into
in
his
chapter
the
psychopathy
of
everyday
things
is
the
need
for
better
design
for
its
impact
on
the
earth
for
peoplepopulationsbeings
other
than
the
direct
users
noise
pollution
chemical
and
solid
waste
pollution
energy
consumption
use
of
nonrecyclables
these
should
be
be
taken
into
consideration
just
as
much
as
an
individual
or
business
concerns
i
visited
the
w4
street
stations
interactive
touchscreen
mta
kiosk
overall
i
think
its
a
useful
tool
riders
can
check
their
routedirections
get
detailed
destination
neighborhood
walking
directions
and
layout
as
well
as
catch
updates
for
the
various
train
lines
arrivals
i
observed
about
7
people
using
the
kiosk
not
as
many
people
as
i
would
have
at
first
thought
when
i
tried
it
out
myself
i
realized
a
couple
of
things
not
many
people
where
using
it
because
they
probably
already
know
where
they
are
going
especially
since
peak
tourist
season
is
ebbing
regular
commuters
dont
need
that
level
of
detail
the
most
useful
and
desired
function
in
my
mind
after
using
mta
for
6
years
is
train
arrival
timetable
it
really
relieves
tension
and
everyone
i
know
loves
it
when
the
red
led
tickers
are
installed
and
working
in
one
of
their
usual
stations
however
this
info
kiosk
only
intermittently
displayed
this
information
the
user
was
unable
to
call
it
up
voluntarily
which
sort
of
defeats
a
large
part
of
the
overall
objective
annoyingly
there
was
more
screentime
devoted
to
advertising
a
solution
to
this
would
be
to
have
the
arrival
time
table
on
one
side
of
the
kiosk
at
all
times
paired
with
brief
full
screen
or
constant
banner
ad
this
way
everyone
on
the
platform
could
have
access
to
the
timetable
while
some
one
was
using
the
otherside
for
directions
other
concerns
where
of
a
sanitary
and
privacysafety
nature
the
kiosk
is
a
giant
touch
screen
and
so
required
constant
tapping
no
one
really
relishes
touching
any
surface
down
in
the
subway
stations
or
inside
cars
especially
not
something
that
strangers
are
constantly
also
touching
with
their
fingers
and
whoknowswhatelse
reducing
the
requirement
for
this
and
improving
the
efficiency
of
the
flow
is
a
possible
solution
maybe
its
zany
and
impractical
but
also
an
antimicrobial
uv
light
or
mist
or
wiper
could
help
the
privacy
concern
occurred
to
me
after
i
left
the
platform
on
my
own
train
home
at
night
i
had
seen
a
woman
use
the
kiosk
and
there
were
a
couple
of
people
behind
her
waiting
to
use
the
kiosk
or
just
watching
what
if
a
vulnerable
tourist
or
other
passenger
tapped
through
the
different
levels
of
details
for
hisher
exact
route
home
while
a
predator
waited
and
looked
on
the
predator
would
then
know
exactly
where
their
prey
was
planning
to
go
possibly
even
all
the
way
to
the
street
they
where
planning
on
ending
up
on
and
then
on
to
their
hotel
or
home
i
noticed
that
users
have
to
tap
out
of
their
directions
to
erase
this
evidence
with
regards
to
this
safety
issue
an
improvement
could
be
one
of
the
angleofview
narrowing
microlouver
films
or
even
a
function
wherein
the
extant
recessed
camera
at
the
top
of
the

could
