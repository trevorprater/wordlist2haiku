# wordlist2haiku
After getting dumped, I scraped all of the text from my lover's blog and 
generated some haikus from her most commonly used words. Sad, right?
It was just a feeble attempt to win her back, but I don't think it worked.
Anyways, maybe someone out there will find this useful one day.

This code will take a list of words and generate haikus from it.
The repo also contains a `trevor-generated` mapping of every word
in the english language to the number of syllables contained in that word.

## Usage
`python words.py | python syl_cnt.py | python haiku.py`
